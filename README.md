# StylishTR
Tiny and stylish lib for multilingual websites in PHP

# How
## How to use it?
You just have to download `StylishTR.php` and import it with a require:
```php
require('StylishTR.php');
```
And just before the beggining of the HTML code:
```php
read();
```

## How does it work?
StylishTR will read your HTML code and replace the variables called {variable} by their translation provided in translations.db

## What about the user?
StylishTR will detect automatically the language of your visitors. If you want to use another language, you can provide ?l=fr/en/es/.. as GET arguments on your page.
